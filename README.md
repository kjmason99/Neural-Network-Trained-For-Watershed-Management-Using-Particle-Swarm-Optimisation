# Neural-Network-Trained-For-Watershed-Management-Using-Particle-Swarm-Optimisation
Author: Karl Mason. 

This code trains a neural network using the particle swarm optimisation algorithm and is applied to the problem of watershed management. 

In order to run the code, make sure that the watershed.java file is referencing the correct location on your PC in order to read in the watershed data. Also ensure that the mainTest.java file references the correct location to print your results to file.
